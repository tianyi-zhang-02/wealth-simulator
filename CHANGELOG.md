# Changelog

Notable changes to **Accretia**. Loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

The project doesn't ship a versioned package — entries are grouped by milestone and dated. The "Live" line at the top of each section names the production URL after that milestone shipped.

## [Unreleased]

### Goal seek: the liquidity-event lever

Some targets (say, $100M) are beyond any savings rate — they're an
exit-sized number, not a budgeting question. Previously all four levers
just said "not reachable" and the panel went silent.

- **Added** a fifth goal-seek lever: **Liquidity event** — the one-time
  windfall (equity exit, business sale, inheritance), landing in the first
  horizon year, that would close the gap. Solved by bisection over the
  engine like every other lever, so it round-trips exactly. Earliest year =
  the minimum possible check; the row says so. Bilingual. 104 tests.

### Unpredictable pay — partner draws, commission

Some careers don't have a salary so much as a distribution: a law-firm
partner's draw can swing ±30% year to year.

- **Added** an optional per-stage **pay swing** (`volatilityPct`, one std
  dev of total comp in %). The deterministic projection is untouched — it
  shows the expected path — but the **Monte Carlo view draws each such
  person-year's comp** (floored at $0) and rolls the swings into the
  p10/p50/p90 bands, alongside market volatility.
- **Changed** the BigLaw preset is now a two-stage **associate → partner**
  track; the partner stage ships with a 30% pay swing.
- Scenarios without volatile stages produce **bit-identical** Monte Carlo
  bands (the income sampler is never invoked — regression-tested). 102
  tests.

### Non-linear careers, made visible

Salaries don't only go up — people plateau, take pay cuts, and step away
from work. The engine's stage model always supported all of that (a stage
with a 0% raise, a negative raise, or a $0 salary), but nothing in the UI
said so.

- **Added** a **+ Career break** quick-add on each person: inserts a
  $0-salary break stage plus a "Back to work" stage two years later that
  resumes the prior stage's full comp (salary, raise, bonus, equity), ready
  to adjust.
- **Added** a hint under Career stages spelling out the patterns: plateaus
  (0% raise), pay cuts (negative raise or a lower-salary stage), time off
  ($0-salary stage). Bilingual.
- **Added** engine tests pinning the break behavior (income stops, bills
  still paid from savings, income resumes) and declining salaries (negative
  raise). 99 tests.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-07-13

The realism-and-delight release: a two-pool cash model, true retirement
modeling, opt-in local save — and the pixel journey, a tiny living world
above the chart.

### Pixel world: the underground

- **Fixed** the rainbow is now clipped against the terrain — on a slope its
  legs stop at the hillside instead of burrowing into the ground.
- **Added** buried **ores** in the dirt (gold veins, gems, rubies, coal
  seams — deterministic scatter, denser at depth), a **cave chamber** under
  the terrain's highest stretch with a **green-eyed critter** that blinks in
  the dark and hops when it thinks nobody's watching, and a **mine gallery**
  with a **miner** (helmet lamp included) swinging a pickaxe on a loop —
  sparks fly, and there's a gem vein he's chasing. All original, procedural
  pixel art.

### Pixel world: FIRE celebration, endless summer, a real sea

- **Added** reaching FIRE now throws a party past that year: a **rainbow**
  arcs over the FIRE house 🌈, **confetti** drifts down (melting at the
  ground), and **fireworks** pop on a loop 🎆.
- **Changed** the world is now in **permanent daytime** — a fixed sun and
  drifting clouds; no more night cycle, stars, or moon (job-loss overcast
  and crash rain still darken their stretch).
- **Fixed** the seaside scene: the tiny floating puddle became a **proper
  sea** — a waterline submerges the terrain's lowest ~28 columns (the
  journey starts at the shore), with animated glints and the sailboat
  anchored mid-water.
- All pixel art is original and drawn procedurally in-repo.

### Retirement realism — people can finally retire

Modeled on full-featured retirement calculators (à la Financial Mentor's
"Ultimate Retirement Calculator"). Previously career income ran to the
horizon end — nobody could retire.

- **Added** a per-person **retire age** (career income stops; absent = the
  old behavior). The projection immediately reflects the earning-years vs
  drawdown-years split, and the pixel journey plants a **deck chair** on the
  retirement year.
- **Added** a **Retirement & other income** section: retirement spending as
  a % of the working baseline (spending usually drops), an optional
  **post-retirement return** (the low–high band keeps its spread), and
  unlimited **income streams** — social security, pensions, rental,
  annuities — each with start/end age, inflation-adjusted (default, like
  CPI-indexed social security) or fixed-nominal, taxed like all income.
- All opt-in — 97 tests, zero regressions.

### Pixel polish

- **Fixed** snowflakes now melt when they reach the ground (never drawn
  below the terrain — the white terrain top reads as snowpack), and larger
  flakes are little ❄-style crosses instead of square dots.

### Opt-in "Save on this device"

- **Added** a **Save on this device** toggle in the scenario bar — tick it
  and your scenarios live in this browser's `localStorage` (single key,
  `accretia:saved:v1`), restored on the next visit so you can continue
  planning. **Default OFF: nothing is stored and a refresh still starts
  clean**, exactly as before. Data stays on your device — still nothing is
  ever sent anywhere; restored data is validated against the schema like
  any untrusted input, and unticking erases the key immediately. Bilingual.
  Privacy copy in both READMEs and the CLAUDE.md rule updated to match.

### Pixel world 2.0 — categories, tiered houses, scenes, stress weather

- **Added** an optional **category** on major expenses (car / home (second
  property) / boat / travel / other). The engine ignores it; the pixel world
  places matching sprites: a little car, a **second house sized by price**
  (~$1M bungalow · ~$3M two-story · $5M+ mansion — the financed first home
  from the mortgage block is tiered the same way), a yacht bobbing on its
  own water, and a suitcase — with a **plane crossing the sky** (contrail
  included) whenever any travel is planned.
- **Added** three switchable **scenes** (palette reskins): Meadow ·
  Seaside (sand palette + a sailboat anchored in a bay at the terrain's
  lowest point) · Snow (white ground + falling snow).
- **Added** stress automation: a **job-loss window now darkens the sky** —
  an overcast band with parked grey clouds over the affected years (a
  market-crash year already rains). Configured tools flow into the world
  automatically. 91 tests.

### Pixel journey — the projection as a tiny living world

- **Added** a **Pixel journey** strip above the chart: the
  terrain follows your real (today's-dollar) net worth, and your milestones
  appear as pixel landmarks — Coast FIRE beach umbrella, Lean-FIRE tent,
  Full-FIRE house with a gold flag, goal flag, home purchase, windfall
  chests, expense signposts, and a storm cloud raining on a market-crash
  year. A little walker crosses the horizon under a sun–moon cycle (gold
  scarf + sparkles once past FIRE), trailed by a cat. Hover any year for
  the number; hide it with one click.
- **Zero dependencies** — procedural `<canvas>` (no images, no libraries),
  no network. Dark/light palettes, bilingual labels, static frame under
  `prefers-reduced-motion`. Purely decorative: same rows as the chart, with
  the layout logic pure and unit-tested (88 tests).

### Two-pool model: bills come first, only invested money compounds

- **Added** an **Invested share of surplus** input (Starting state, default
  100%; new scenarios seed 80%). Savings is still derived from after-tax
  income − spending, but only that share of a positive surplus goes into the
  **invested pool** — the rest stays as **cash**: it counts in net worth but
  earns nothing. Not everything you keep gets to eat the returns. Bilingual.
- **Fixed** `startingInvested` was collected and validated but **ignored** —
  the engine grew your entire starting net worth at the investment return.
  Now only the invested pool compounds; the gap sits as cash.
- **Fixed** FIRE milestones counted **home equity** toward the 25× number.
  They now use investable (ex-home) real net worth — you can't withdraw 4%
  of a house. Disclaimer updated.
- **Changed** shortfalls and housing costs draw **cash first**, then
  investments; a market-crash stress now hits only the invested pool (your
  checking account doesn't crash). With no mortgage, 100% share, and
  starting net worth fully invested, results are bit-identical to before
  (regression-tested; 82 tests).

### UI flow — findability and stickiness

- **Changed** the asset-mix calculator moved out of the global "advanced
  tools" toggle (which lives in the *other* column) into its own inline
  disclosure inside Investment & inflation — where returns are edited.
- **Fixed** the projection column no longer pins (`sticky`) while advanced
  tools are open — a pinned column taller than the viewport made its lower
  panels unreachable.
- **Fixed** header controls wrap on narrow screens.

- **Docs** — refreshed README (EN + 中文) for the full v1.0.0 feature set
  (FIRE, Monte Carlo, stress test, mortgage, asset mix, themes) and added a
  release / license badge.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-07-07

First tagged release of **Accretia** — a complete, bilingual, fully
client-side wealth-projection simulator.

_Live: https://accretia.vercel.app_

### More conservative default returns

- **Changed** the default return assumption from 7% (band 4–10) to a more
  cautious **6% nominal (band 3–9)** — ≈ 3% real at 3% inflation — after
  feedback that the projection looked over-optimistic. Only the seed default
  changed; existing/imported scenarios and the engine are untouched.

### Home & mortgage what-if

- **Added** a bilingual (EN / 中文) **Home & mortgage** section. When enabled,
  net worth becomes **investable balance + (home value − mortgage balance)**:
  the down payment converts cash to equity; each year the mortgage payment
  splits into **interest** (a real cost) and **principal** (net-worth-neutral,
  cash → equity); **property tax** + maintenance are costs; the home
  **appreciates**. Inputs: purchase year, price, down %, rate, term, property
  tax %, maintenance %, appreciation %; shows the **monthly P&I** payment.
- **Engine**: the model is part of the main projection, so the chart, FIRE,
  Monte Carlo, and stress test all account for it. Additive — with no
  mortgage, net worth is **exactly** as before (regression-tested). 75 tests
  total.

### Display preferences — font size + light theme

- **Added** header controls: **A− / A+** to zoom the whole page, and a
  **☀ / ☾** toggle for a **light theme** (warm off-white with darker
  accent/positive/negative for contrast). Both are in-memory preferences
  (reset on refresh, per the no-storage rule) — theme via
  `<html data-theme>`, zoom via the page `zoom`. Bilingual labels.

### Less clutter — collapse set-once form sections

- **Changed** the Horizon and Taxes sections to collapsed by default (they're
  usually set once). The form now opens with just the three you actually
  tweak — Starting state, Investment & inflation, and People & careers — with
  the rest one click away.

### Monte Carlo — deterministic ⇄ probabilistic switch

- **Added** a **Deterministic / Probabilistic** switch on the projection
  chart. Probabilistic mode runs 1,000 seeded random market paths on your
  assumptions (a **Volatility** input, default 15%) and draws a
  **p10 / p50 / p90** fan; with a goal-seek target set, it also shows your
  **success probability** ("82% chance of hitting your goal"). Real,
  today's-dollar basis. Bilingual (EN / 中文).
- **Engine**: additive only — a pure `runMonteCarlo` layer reuses the exact
  cash-flow math via an optional per-year return sampler on
  `simulateScenario`; `simulate()` and every existing call are unchanged.
  Seeded, so the bands don't flicker. **Regression-tested: volatility 0
  reproduces the deterministic projection exactly.** 70 tests total.

### Simple by default — advanced tools collapsed

- **Changed** the projection to progressive disclosure: by default it shows
  just the essentials (inputs + chart + final balance). A **Show advanced
  tools** toggle reveals goal-seek, FIRE, the stress test, and the asset-mix
  calculator. Keeps first use simple without hiding the power. Bilingual
  (EN / 中文); the choice is in-memory (resets on refresh).

### Asset-mix return calculator

- **Added** a bilingual (EN / 中文) asset-allocation calculator in the
  Investment section: blend an expected return from a rough mix — stocks,
  high-yield savings (~3–4%), bonds, real estate — where each bucket's net
  return is its return **minus a carrying cost** (e.g. property tax on real
  estate). Shows the weight-normalized blended return and Applies it to the
  low–base–high return band. Transient like the tax estimator — illustrative,
  no engine or schema change. (Full per-year real-estate + property-tax
  modeling will come with the mortgage what-if.)

### Stress test — job loss + market crash what-ifs

- **Added** a bilingual (EN / 中文) Stress-test panel — a deterministic
  "what if it goes wrong" overlay. Model a **job loss** (a person's, or
  everyone's, income scales to a kept-% for N years) and/or a **market
  crash** (one year's return overridden, e.g. −37% for a 2008-style year),
  with one-click presets. Shows baseline-vs-stressed final net worth (delta
  + %) and the trough (lowest point + year). The main projection is
  unchanged — the engine applies the shocks only for this panel.
- **Engine**: `simulate(assumptions, stress?)` gains an optional stress
  overlay; existing `simulate(a)` calls are unaffected. New optional
  `stress` block in the scenario schema (rides in export/import). Covered by
  unit tests (66 total). First of the risk-modeling features (Monte-Carlo
  probabilistic version and mortgage what-if to follow).

### Removed Vercel Web Analytics

- **Removed** the `@vercel/analytics` package and the `<Analytics />` tracker
  that a Vercel "Enable Analytics" flow had auto-added (PR #26). It was the
  only tracking script in the project and it conflicts with the app's
  no-tracking / nothing-sent privacy stance. Runtime deps are back to just
  `next` / `react` / `react-dom` / `recharts` / `zod`; `npm audit` clean.
  (Analytics should also be turned off in the Vercel dashboard so it isn't
  re-added.)

### FIRE panel — the year work becomes optional

- **Added** a bilingual (EN / 中文) FIRE panel in the projection column. It
  **derives** — from the existing projection, no engine change — the first
  year your real (today's-dollar) net worth reaches your FIRE number
  (annual spend ÷ withdrawal rate; 25× at 4%). Shows **Full FIRE**, **Lean
  FIRE** (via a separate essential-spend input, for needs-vs-wants), and
  **Coast FIRE** (the year you can stop saving and let compounding reach Full
  FIRE by 65).
- **Added** inputs: safe-withdrawal-rate (default 4%), an annual
  health-insurance reserve (added to spend — matters pre-Medicare), and
  essential annual spend. New optional `fire` block in the scenario schema
  (rides along in export/import). Pure helper `src/lib/simulator/fire.ts`
  with unit tests (60 total).

### Chart: nominal vs real comparison view

- **Added** a third projection mode, **对比 / Both**: the chart draws the
  nominal line (solid) and the real / today's-dollars line (dashed)
  together, with the gap between them shaded — a direct visual of the
  purchasing power lost to inflation. The tooltip shows both values and the
  gap; the caption explains the shaded area. The single 名义 / 实际 views are
  unchanged. Presentation only — no engine change.

### Role library — bilingual + medicine & finance tracks

- **Added** Chinese titles + notes to **every** role (the picker shows them
  in `?lang=zh`, and search matches EN + 中文), plus two new tracks:
  **医疗 / Medicine** (13 roles: resident → NP/PA → primary care →
  specialists incl. anesthesiology, radiology, surgery, orthopedics,
  cardiology; base + productivity bonus, no equity) and **金融 / 咨询
  (Finance / Consulting)** (IB analyst/associate/VP, PE associate, hedge-fund
  analyst, quant, MBB consultant; cash-bonus-heavy, PE carry noted as not
  modeled). Also added Product Manager and Data Scientist (mid/senior) to the
  tech track.
- **Note** these are hand-curated **static** illustrative figures
  (levels.fyi / Medscape-style aggregates), not fetched live — the app makes
  no network calls. Every number stays editable; "last reviewed 2026-07".

### Native bilingual — English / 简体中文

- **Added** full native Chinese (简体中文) support, built bilingual from the
  start so the copy reads as _written_, not translated (净资产 / 复利 /
  税后收入 / 隐含储蓄率 / 目标求解 …). An `EN · 中文` switch sits in the
  header, and there is now a Chinese README (`README.zh-CN.md`) linked from
  the English one.
- **Changed** the active language lives in the `?lang=zh` URL param —
  shareable and refresh-safe with **no storage** (consistent with the app's
  no-storage rule); the browser language is auto-detected on first load
  (`useSyncExternalStore`, SSR-safe). Currency stays USD (presets are
  US-based; zh renders `US$…` and chart axes use 万/亿 via `Intl`).
- **Added** `src/lib/i18n/` — a typed EN/ZH message catalog (`Messages` is
  derived from `en`, so a missing zh key is a compile error) + locale-aware
  `Intl` formatters, plus `components/i18n/lang-switch.tsx`. Every
  interactive surface (assumptions form, goal-seek, tables, compare, chart)
  is translated. Role titles / US state names stay as library data in
  English (Chinese tech usage commonly keeps these untranslated).

### Renamed to Accretia

- **Changed** the project/repo name to **Accretia** — from _accretion_,
  growth by gradual accumulation (the essence of compounding), and picked
  to be distinctive rather than collide with the many "wealth trackers" /
  "wealth simulators" out there. GitHub repo renamed `tracker` →
  `accretia` (old URLs auto-redirect); updated `package.json` name, the
  PWA manifest (`name`/`short_name` → "Accretia"), the page + browser-tab
  titles, the visible `<h1>`, README, CLAUDE.md, and this file's compare
  link. The Vercel project + live URL keep their existing names.

### Comp model: equity, derived savings, tax presets

- **Changed** the cash-flow model to **derived savings**: removed the
  `annualSavingsRatePct` input; each year `saved = after-tax income −
  spending`. Can go negative (drawdown). The implied savings rate is now
  shown as an OUTPUT in the projection panel. Engine assumption #6/#6a
  rewritten; tests re-verified with new hand-computed cases. (Imported
  JSON that still carries `annualSavingsRatePct` is accepted and the
  value ignored — zod strips it.)
- **Added** equity / RSU compensation: `careerStage.annualEquity`
  (optional) is added flat to gross income each year of the stage and
  taxed like salary (RSUs vest as W-2 income). Every role preset now
  carries a realistic equity figure — for big-tech / frontier-AI roles
  it's the largest component. Career-preset SWE/EM stages updated too.
  New "Equity / RSU per year" field on each career stage.
- **Added** `tax-presets.ts` — a rough state (50 + DC) + federal
  effective-rate lookup with a `TAX_LAST_REVIEWED` date. New Taxes-section
  helper: pick a state + income → estimated combined effective rate →
  Apply (then fine-tune). Clearly labeled illustrative, not tax advice.
- **Changed** the role picker from search-only to a **browsable list
  grouped by track** (Legal · Software/ML) with search on top; role lines
  now show equity alongside base/bonus/raise.
- **Changed** the default scenario now seeds one earner (SWE with equity)
  so the first-load projection is illustrative rather than an all-drawdown
  line.

### Live side-by-side editor

- **Changed** the simulator from a three-tab layout to a **live side-by-side
  editor**: assumptions on the left, the projection (final balance + chart +
  goal-seek) pinned (`sticky`) on the right, so editing an assumption updates
  the chart in real time. On mobile it stacks — projection on top, assumptions
  below.
- **Changed** Compare is now a toggle in the scenario bar (swaps the editor
  for the compare view) instead of a third tab.
- **Changed** page container widened to `max-w-6xl` to fit the two columns;
  the year-by-year table sits full-width below the split.

### Stripped to a client-only simulator

The project is now **purely a client-side wealth-projection simulator** —
no backend, no database, no auth, and nothing stored or cached anywhere.
The owner moved day-to-day tracking to a real brokerage and wanted just
the projection tool.

- **Removed** all tracking, auth, and backend: accounts, transactions,
  snapshots, savings goals, holdings, portfolio, tax-lots, dashboard,
  magic-link auth, every `/api/*` route, the entire Supabase layer
  (schema, migrations, clients), the Alpha Vantage quote proxy + price
  cache, and all related validation / types / helpers. (Preserved in
  git history.)
- **Removed** all environment variables — the app needs none.
- **Changed** the app is now a single page (`/`) rendering the
  simulator entirely client-side. Scenarios live in memory; a refresh
  resets. Persistence is manual **Export / Import** of a scenario as a
  JSON file (imports validated against the engine's Zod schema).
- **Added** JSON **import** (export already existed) and a cleaner
  three-tab layout — **Projection · Assumptions · Compare** — with a
  scenario bar on top.
- **Changed** `src/proxy.ts` down to CSP-nonce only (no Supabase /
  session / auth). Strict CSP retained; `connect-src` is now `'self'`
  since the app makes no network calls.
- **Removed** dependencies: `@supabase/ssr`, `@supabase/supabase-js`,
  `@hookform/resolvers`, `react-hook-form`, `lucide-react`,
  `server-only`, and the `@electric-sql/pglite` devDep. Runtime deps
  are now just `next`, `react`, `react-dom`, `recharts`, `zod`.
- **Removed** now-obsolete docs (self-hosting guide, deploy runbook,
  spec files, data-model architecture doc). README + CLAUDE.md
  rewritten for the client-only app. `npm audit`: 0 vulnerabilities.

### Projection-first re-focus

The app is now projection-first: the wealth simulator is the home screen,
and manual tracking (accounts, portfolio, transactions, snapshots, goals)
is secondary — reachable via Settings but no longer in the primary nav —
now that a real brokerage handles day-to-day tracking. **Nothing was
deleted and there are no DB changes; this is a reversible re-focus.**

- **Changed** Home `/` now renders the wealth-projection simulator (was
  the net-worth dashboard).
- **Changed** The net-worth dashboard moved to `/dashboard` (unchanged
  otherwise, still fully working).
- **Changed** `/simulator` now permanently redirects to `/` so old
  bookmarks / links keep working.
- **Changed** Bottom nav is projection-first:
  **Projection (`/`) · Dashboard (`/dashboard`) · [＋ new scenario] ·
  Compare (`/?view=compare`) · Settings**.
- **Added** Deep-link entry points on the simulator: `/?new=1` starts a
  fresh scenario (the "+" button), `/?view=compare` opens directly into
  the compare view.
- **Changed** The "+" sheet's primary action is now "New projection
  scenario"; the tracking shortcuts (add transaction / holding / account,
  update balances) remain under a muted "Tracking (optional)" subheader.
- **Changed** Settings gained a "Tracking (optional)" section linking the
  dashboard, accounts, portfolio, transactions, goals, and bulk-balance
  update — so nothing is orphaned by leaving the primary nav.
- **Changed** README Features reframed projection-first.

### Migration test harness — pglite

- **Added** `@electric-sql/pglite` as a devDep — Postgres compiled to WASM,
  ~3MB. Lets us run migration safety checks against real Postgres
  semantics in CI / locally without needing a Postgres daemon or Docker.
- **Added** `supabase/migrations/0003_holding_lots.rollback-test.mjs` —
  pins the four rollback verification cases that were run by hand during
  PR #9 review (GOOD case + three BAD cases including the 1e-8 precision
  boundary). Run with `npm run test:migrations`. Exits non-zero if any
  case behaves unexpectedly.
- **Added** `npm run test:migrations` script.
- **Convention**: future migrations that ship a safety check should
  include a sibling `NNNN_xxx.rollback-test.mjs` and extend the
  `test:migrations` script (or chain via `&&`) to invoke it. Documented
  in `supabase/migrations/README.md`.

### Phase 4 — tax lots (data model only)

- **Added** `public.holding_lots` table. One acquisition-event per row,
  rolling up into a holding. Columns: `quantity`, `cost_basis`,
  `acquired_on`, `acquired_on_estimated`. RLS on, owner-only policy
  (`auth.uid() = user_id`). Indexes on `user_id` and `holding_id`.
- **Added** classification contract for `acquired_on_estimated`:
  pinned into the database catalog via `comment on column` (so it
  travels with the schema), documented in the migration source, and
  expanded in `ARCHITECTURE.md` § Classification contract. Short
  version: classification code MUST check the flag first and treat
  estimated-date lots as "needs review" rather than feeding the
  placeholder date into the 365-day LT/ST cutoff.
- **Added** migration `0003_holding_lots.sql`. Additive and
  forward-only:
  - Wraps the entire migration in an explicit `begin; ... commit;` so
    self-hosters never end up in a half-applied state.
  - Backfills one lot per existing holding mirroring `quantity` and
    `cost_basis` to the cent, with `acquired_on = created_at::date` and
    `acquired_on_estimated = true` so the UI can render the date as a
    placeholder until the user supplies a real acquisition date.
  - Idempotent — re-running skips holdings that already have at least
    one lot.
  - Transactional safety check at the end: RAISES and rolls back the
    entire transaction if any holding's lot sums don't equal the
    holding total to the cent.
- **Added** `supabase/migrations/0003_holding_lots.test.ts` — JS-level
  verification of the backfill mapping with a fixture covering integer
  shares, fractional DRIP shares, 8-decimal crypto, zero-quantity
  closed positions, and zero-cost-basis gifts. Demo block prints
  before/after portfolio totals to the cent.
- **Added** `ARCHITECTURE.md` — full data-model reference (every table +
  RLS pattern + holdings ↔ holding_lots invariant) and module map.
  Linked from README.
- **Changed** `supabase/schema.sql` includes the `holding_lots` table
  inline so a fresh installation gets it without applying 0003 — the
  migration file is for upgrade paths only.
- **Changed** `supabase/migrations/README.md` documents 0003: what it
  adds, the backup-before-apply requirement, and the transactional
  safety check.

### Phase 3 — documentation + self-hosting (PR #8)

- **Added** `SELF_HOSTING_GUIDE.md` — dogfooded fork-and-deploy walkthrough,
  including the `?type=email` magic-link URL fix (`/auth/confirm` rejects
  links without it) and a Resend SMTP setup section (Supabase's default
  sender is dev-only and silently breaks deliverability in production).
- **Added** `CHANGELOG.md` (this file) — milestone-grouped, backfilled.
- **Added** `supabase/migrations/README.md` — apply-order + rules.
- **Added** `README.md` Architecture section documenting
  `src/lib/derived/networth.ts` as the single source of truth for every
  net-worth surface.
- **Added** `CLAUDE.md` "Every PR Updates Its Own Docs" rule — every
  behavior-changing PR must update CHANGELOG, README, .env.example,
  SELF_HOSTING_GUIDE, migrations docs, and spec files in the same PR.
- **Added** `husky` + `.husky/pre-commit` running `gitleaks` against
  staged changes. Prints a friendly install hint and exits 0 if
  gitleaks isn't installed locally (opinionated trade-off — don't
  block unrelated commits just because a dev hasn't set up the tool
  yet). Bypass for legitimate edge cases: `git commit --no-verify`.
- **Added** `package.json` `engines.node = ">=20.19"` — enforces the
  Node version `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss` already requires.
- **Removed** false claim in the previous README that gitleaks
  pre-commit was already wired up. As of this PR, it actually is.
- **Security note (not a code change in this PR):** vitest advisory
  [GHSA-5xrq-8626-4rwp](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5xrq-8626-4rwp)
  affects `vitest < 4.1.0` only when the `vitest --ui` server is
  listening. This project runs `vitest run` (one-shot) and never starts
  the UI server — not exploitable in this codebase. Logged in CLAUDE.md
  Known security debt #4 with the assessment for future re-evaluation.

## Public Wealth Simulator — 2026-06-02 _(PR #7, merge `02542b7`)_

- **Added** `/sim`: a public, no-login Wealth Projection Simulator. Anyone can
  open the URL and run the full v2 simulator (assumptions form, role library,
  lifestyle creep, goal-seek, chart, year table, compare) entirely
  client-side. Nothing is saved to the server; "save" is replaced by an
  in-browser JSON download.
- **Architecture** Shared simulator UI components extracted from
  `src/app/(app)/simulator/` to `src/components/simulator/` so the public
  client can import them without touching auth chrome. `CompareView` type
  narrowed from server-row `Scenario` to `ComparableScenario`
  (`{id, name, assumptions}`).
- **Security (the wall)** Public route has zero forbidden imports
  (`supabase`, `env.server`, `/derived/`, `@/app/api/`, etc.) — verified
  by recursive import-graph audit. Proxy allowlist is exact-match. CSP
  still strict — page uses `await connection()` to force dynamic render
  so the per-request nonce is applied to every script.

## Simulator v2 — 2026-05-31 _(PR #5, merge `344e3e5`)_

- **Added** Searchable career role library (10 legal + 11 SWE/MLE roles)
  per career stage. Each role fills `baseSalary` / `annualRaisePct` /
  `bonusPct`; everything stays editable. Labeled "starting estimates,
  not market data."
- **Added** Lifestyle creep modeling. Two opt-in modes on `assumptions.lifestyle`:
  - `flat`: `expenses_i = base × (1+infl)^(i+1) × (1+creep)^(i+1)`
  - `incomeScaled`: absorbs `creepShareOfRaisePct` % of each after-tax
    raise into the next year's expense baseline; pay cuts clamped
    (sticky-downward).
    Composes with the savings-rate cap — never double-counts. Documented as
    engine assumption #6a.
- **Added** Goal-seek mode. User sets `target = { amount, age }` and the
  simulator solves four levers by **bisection over the verified engine**
  (no closed-form): extra monthly contribution, return %, annual expenses,
  target age. Round-trip verification: every solved value, fed back into
  the engine, hits the target within $1k.
- **Fixed** `0`-prefill input bug across every numeric field. New
  `NumField` uses local string drafts + select-on-focus.
- **Fixed** `netWorthAtAge` linearly interpolates between adjacent year
  rows so the age lever returns a continuous fractional answer (caught
  via the demo verification — original tests silently passed on NaN).

## Polish phase — 2026-05-30 _(PR #1, merge `1dd518a`)_

- **Architecture** Canonical net-worth helper at `src/lib/derived/networth.ts` —
  **single source of truth** for the dashboard, accounts list total,
  `/api/networth`, simulator prefill, and goal progress. Snapshot-
  authoritative with live-holdings fill for brokerage/retirement/crypto
  accounts that have no snapshot. See `README.md` Architecture for the
  contract.
- **Added** Plus-menu bottom sheet for cross-feature creation
  (transaction / holding / account / snapshot). Deep-link entry points
  via `?add=1` on accounts and portfolio.
- **Added** Unified toast system (`src/components/ui/toast.tsx`) and shared
  money formatter (`src/lib/format/money.ts`).
- **Added** lucide-react icons across the bottom nav with warm-gold accent
  for the active tab.

## Step 14 — Deploy — 2026-05-31 _(PR #4 + #6)_

- **Deployed** to https://accretia.vercel.app on Vercel.
  Zero-config Next 16 build (no `vercel.json`). One-project Supabase setup.
- **Added** `STEP_14_DEPLOY.md` operator runbook.

## Step 13 — Security hardening — 2026-05-31 _(PR #3, merge `b00538d`)_

- **Security** Per-request CSP nonce in `src/proxy.ts`:
  `script-src 'self' 'nonce-X' 'strict-dynamic'` (no `unsafe-inline`, no
  `unsafe-eval`). `style-src 'self' 'nonce-X'`. `style-src-attr 'unsafe-inline'`
  accepted as the documented narrow escape hatch for Recharts SVG +
  dynamic `style={...}` JSX.
- **Security** Static security headers in `next.config.ts`: HSTS
  (prod-only), X-Frame-Options DENY, X-Content-Type-Options nosniff,
  Referrer-Policy same-origin, Permissions-Policy lockdown.
- **Security** Migration `0002_revoke_rls_auto_enable_grants.sql`:
  revokes EXECUTE on `public.rls_auto_enable()` from PUBLIC/anon/
  authenticated, grants only to service_role. Closes Supabase Advisor
  warnings #1 and #2.
- **Security** `npm audit` to 0/0/0 via `postcss` override forcing
  Next's nested 8.4.31 to 8.5.15 (GHSA-qx2v-qp2m-jg93).
- **Audit pass** Origin checks on every mutating route (16/16); every
  `z.string()` bounded by `.max() / .length() / .uuid() / .email() / .regex()`.

## Step 12 — PWA polish — _(direct push pre-PR-workflow)_

- **Added** `manifest.ts` + `ImageResponse`-generated icons (32 / 180 /
  192 / 512) + hand-rolled service worker (`public/sw.js`). No new deps.
- iOS `apple-web-app` meta + `format-detection: telephone=no` so
  tabular figures don't become accidental tap targets.

## Step 11 — Export — _(pre-PR)_

- **Added** Export endpoints: `/api/export/transactions.csv`,
  `/api/export/holdings.csv`, `/api/export/backup.json`.
- **Added** Optional **client-side AES-GCM encryption** for the JSON
  backup. PBKDF2-SHA-256 with 600k iterations (OWASP 2023). Passphrase
  never leaves the browser; no server route involved in encryption.
  Matching decrypt-to-view flow on `/settings/export`.

## Step 10 — Wealth simulator — _(pre-PR)_

- **Added** Full household wealth simulator: scenarios CRUD, pure
  deterministic engine (`src/lib/simulator/engine.ts`) with documented
  end-of-year inflation convention, low/mid/high return bands, multi-
  person careers, windfalls, major expenses. Compare across saved
  scenarios. "Use my actual data" prefill.
- **Engine sign-off** 24 tests including three sanity cases (compounding,
  ordinary-annuity closed form, real-dollars hand-check) and two
  coherence proofs (windfall+expense same-year cancel; final-year
  expense uses same period count as net-worth column).

## Step 9 — Holdings + Alpha Vantage proxy — _(pre-PR)_

- **Added** Holdings CRUD scoped to brokerage/retirement/crypto accounts.
- **Added** `/api/quotes` server-only proxy: `requireUser` first → rate
  limit (60/hr per user) → validate symbols → restrict to symbols the
  caller owns → cache to `price_cache` table (1h TTL crypto / 1h
  market-hours equities / 24h otherwise) → fall back to stale cache on
  upstream rate-limit rather than failing.

## Step 8 — Savings goals — _(pre-PR)_

- **Added** Savings goals CRUD with progress bars, percent complete,
  projected completion dates, linked-account auto-progress.

## Step 7 — Snapshots + net worth chart — _(pre-PR)_

- **Added** Single + bulk month-end snapshots. `/api/networth`
  aggregator. 12-month Recharts line chart on the dashboard.
  `/accounts/:id` drill-down with snapshot history.

## Step 6 — Transactions CRUD — _(pre-PR)_

- **Added** Transactions API routes, filterable list, add/edit/delete
  form, categories autocomplete.

## Step 5 — Accounts CRUD — _(pre-PR)_

- **Added** Accounts API routes, list page, add/edit/archive form.

## Step 4 — Layout shell — _(pre-PR)_

- **Added** Fonts (IBM Plex Sans + Fraunces + Geist Mono), bottom nav,
  `(app)` route group, placeholder section pages.

## Step 3 — Auth — _(pre-PR)_

- **Added** Magic-link auth (Supabase email OTP). 8-digit code flow.
  Proxy allowlists `/api/auth/send-otp` and `/api/auth/verify-otp`.
- **Fixed** Stage-2 sign-in `handleSubmit` silent failure — client-only
  token-shape schema so the empty email field doesn't fail zod
  validation invisibly.

## Step 2 — Schema — _(pre-PR)_

- **Added** `supabase/schema.sql` — accounts, transactions,
  account_snapshots, savings_goals, holdings, price_cache, user_settings.
  RLS on every user table; `auth.uid() = user_id` policy.

## Step 1 — Repo init — _(pre-PR)_

- Next.js 16 App Router scaffold, TypeScript strict, Tailwind v4, npm.
