   Alpha Vantage (quote provider, free tier)
```

Browsers never call Supabase or Alpha Vantage directly. Every cross-process boundary that touches user data has a Next.js API route in front of it.

## Data model

All tables live in the `public` schema. Every user table:

- Has a `user_id uuid not null references auth.users(id) on delete cascade` column.
- Has Row Level Security enabled.
- Has exactly one RLS policy: `using (auth.uid() = user_id) with check (auth.uid() = user_id)`.

The exception is [`price_cache`](#price_cache) — RLS is enabled but with **no policies** so only the service-role key can read or write it.

### User-owned tables

| Table | Purpose | Key fields | RLS |
|---|---|---|---|
| `accounts` | User-defined accounts (cash / savings / brokerage / retirement / crypto / other). One row per logical account. | `name`, `type`, `currency`, `archived_at` | `user_id` |
| `transactions` | Income, expenses, savings deposits and withdrawals attached to an account. | `account_id`, `kind`, `amount`, `category`, `occurred_on`, `note` | `user_id` |
| `account_snapshots` | Point-in-time balance for one account on one date. The user enters these manually (single or bulk month-end form). Drives the historical net-worth chart. | `account_id`, `balance`, `snapshot_date` | `user_id` |
| `savings_goals` | Named targets with monthly contributions and optional linked accounts. | `name`, `target_amount`, `target_date`, `monthly_contribution`, `linked_account_id` | `user_id` |
| `holdings` | One row per (account, symbol) for brokerage / retirement / crypto. Total `quantity` and `cost_basis` are the **sum of the holding's lots** (see [`holding_lots`](#holding_lots) below). | `account_id`, `symbol`, `asset_type`, `quantity`, `cost_basis` | `user_id` |
| `holding_lots` | Per-acquisition lots that roll up into a holding. Each lot has its own `acquired_on` date which drives long-term vs short-term tax classification. | `holding_id`, `quantity`, `cost_basis`, `acquired_on`, `acquired_on_estimated` | `user_id` |
| `user_settings` | Per-user preferences. Phase 4 part 2 added `effective_lt_tax_rate_pct` + `effective_st_tax_rate_pct` for the per-lot tax estimate. One row per user, lazy-created on first read. | `default_currency`, `inflation_assumption`, `effective_lt_tax_rate_pct`, `effective_st_tax_rate_pct` | `user_id` |
| `scenarios` | Saved wealth-simulator scenarios. `assumptions` is a `jsonb` blob validated with the same zod schema the engine reads. | `name`, `assumptions` (jsonb) | `user_id` |

### Server-only tables

| Table | Purpose | Access |
|---|---|---|
| `price_cache` | Cached Alpha Vantage quote responses, keyed by symbol. TTL: 1h for crypto, 1h for equities during US market hours (Mon–Fri 13:30–21:00 UTC), 24h outside market hours. | service-role key only (RLS enabled, no policies) |

### Holdings ↔ holding_lots — the lot accounting invariant

Phase 4 introduced `holding_lots` so a single holding can be sliced into multiple acquisition events (each with its own date) for tax-classification purposes. The invariant that keeps reads consistent and migrations safe:

> **For every holding `h`:**
> `sum(lot.quantity)   = h.quantity`
> `sum(lot.cost_basis) = h.cost_basis`
> **to the cent.**

The 0003 migration enforces this invariant at apply time — it RAISES and rolls back the entire transaction if any holding's lot sums don't match. The application maintains the invariant going forward (work delivered in Phase 4 part 2): every code path that mutates `holding_lots` calls [`syncHoldingTotals`](src/lib/holdings/sync-totals.ts), which recomputes the holding columns from `sum(lots)` in scaled-integer arithmetic. The single existing `PATCH /api/holdings/[id]` endpoint that allows direct edits of `quantity` / `cost_basis` now refuses multi-lot holdings (409 `multi_lot_holding_use_lot_endpoints`) and mirrors single-lot edits onto the lot in the same request.

For all current reads (portfolio value, dashboard net worth via [`computeNetWorth`](#canonical-net-worth-helper), CSV export), the existing `holdings.quantity` and `holdings.cost_basis` columns remain authoritative. Lot data is additive — code that doesn't care about lots can keep reading the holding columns as before.

#### Classification contract — `acquired_on_estimated`

Backfilled lots have `acquired_on = holdings.created_at::date` and `acquired_on_estimated = true`. The date is when the holding was first added to *tracker*, **not** the real acquisition date. For users who set up the app recently it's effectively "today," and using it as the input to long-term vs short-term classification would mislabel every existing position as short-term.

The contract (enforced via SQL `comment on column` so it travels with the DB, and documented in the migration source):

1. **Long-term / short-term classification MUST first check `acquired_on_estimated`.** When `true`:
   - Do not compute LT/ST from `acquired_on`.
   - Render the lot as "acquisition date needs review" with a CTA to set a real date.
   - Do not include the lot in any aggregate tax-impact estimate (LT vs ST gains, hypothetical-sale tax) until the user replaces the estimated date with a real one.
2. **Lots with `acquired_on_estimated = false`** are user-confirmed and may participate in classification + tax estimates per the 365-day rule.
3. **Editing a lot's `acquired_on` in the UI MUST also set `acquired_on_estimated = false`** in the same write. The flag is only `true` on rows the user has never reviewed.

The Phase 4 follow-up PR that builds the classification UI / tax estimate MUST honor this contract — the next reviewer should reject the PR if it doesn't.

## Canonical derivations

Two helpers live under `src/lib/derived/`. Both are `'server-only'`. **They are the only correct way to compute the values they own.** Don't recompute net worth or baseline cashflow inline in a route — call these.

### Canonical net-worth helper — `src/lib/derived/networth.ts`

`computeNetWorth(supabase, userId)` returns the dashboard hero number, the accounts-list total, the per-account breakdown with source-of-value annotation, and the 12-month historical series for the chart. Called by:

- `/api/networth` (dashboard, simulator prefill, goal progress)
- Server components that need a balance figure directly without an HTTP round-trip

Holdings → net-worth model (decided during polish §1):

- **Brokerage / retirement / crypto WITH a snapshot for any date:** the latest snapshot wins. Holdings are informational on the portfolio page only.
- **Brokerage / retirement / crypto WITHOUT a snapshot but WITH holdings:** balance = `sum(quantity × live price)`. On Alpha Vantage failure (rate-limited, unknown symbol), falls back to `cost_basis` for that holding so the account isn't silently zeroed.
- **Cash / savings / other:** snapshot wins, with 0 fallback.

The per-account `source` field (`'snapshot' | 'holdings' | 'none'`) tells the UI which path was used.

### Canonical cashflow helper — `src/lib/derived/cashflow.ts`

Sibling helper. Aggregates the user's transaction history into trailing baseline expenses + savings rate + months observed. Powers the simulator's "Use my actual data" prefill.

## Other significant modules

### Pure simulation engine — `src/lib/simulator/engine.ts`

`simulate(assumptions)` is a deterministic pure function returning year-by-year rows. No I/O, no DB. Documented end-of-year inflation convention (row `i` values are nominal at T=i+1), eight enumerated simplifying assumptions, lifestyle-creep modes that compose with the savings-rate cap without double-counting (assumption #6a). 54 tests across `engine.test.ts` + `goalSeek.test.ts` + `scenarios-demo.test.ts` + `simulator-v2-demo.test.ts`.

The pure-function design is what lets [`/sim`](#public-simulator-) reuse the engine without importing any data layer.

### Goal-seek solver — `src/lib/simulator/goalSeek.ts`

Bisection-over-the-engine. Reuses the verified engine instead of deriving closed-form formulas. Solves four levers independently: extra monthly contribution, return %, annual expenses, target age. Round-trip verification in `goalSeek.test.ts` confirms that every solved value, fed back into the engine, hits the target within $1k.

### Alpha Vantage proxy + cache — `src/lib/quotes/`

`alphavantage.ts` is the upstream client. `cache.ts` reads/writes `price_cache` with the TTL policy described above. Both are `'server-only'`. The browser never sees the API key — it hits `/api/quotes` and the server enforces auth, restricts requested symbols to ones the user owns, rate-limits per user (60/hr), and proxies.

### Proxy (Next.js 16 middleware) — `src/proxy.ts`

Per-request CSP nonce generation, public-path allowlist (`PUBLIC_PATHS` — **exact match only**), Supabase session refresh. The exact-match invariant matters: widening to a prefix like `/sim/` would silently auto-public any future `/sim/something-private` subpath.

### Public simulator — `src/app/sim/`

Mirrors the authed `/simulator` UI but with all data wiring stripped. No `fetch()` to any `/api/*` route. No Supabase imports. Saves are replaced by an in-browser JSON download. Shares the simulator UI components from `src/components/simulator/` with the authed twin (the components themselves are data-free; data wiring is in the route-level clients only).

Verified during PR #7: recursive import-graph audit, exact-match proxy allowlist, no `fetch()` calls in source or rendered HTML, CSP nonce coverage 17/17.
