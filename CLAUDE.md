## 🔒 Security Rules (Non-Negotiable)

This is a **public GitHub repo**. Assume a hostile stranger reads every commit. These rules are not suggestions.

### Secrets

1. **Never write a secret into code.** All secrets come from `process.env`. If you find yourself typing an API key, URL with credentials, or token directly into a file, stop.
2. **Never commit `.env*` files** (except `.env.example` with placeholder values). Verify `.gitignore` covers them before every commit.
3. **Run `git status` before every `git add`.** If you see `.env`, `.env.local`, or anything that looks like a secret file, stop and tell the user.
4. **If a secret is needed in a client component, that's a design error.** Route the call through a Next.js API route so the secret stays server-side. Never use `NEXT_PUBLIC_` for anything sensitive — that prefix exposes the value to the browser bundle.
5. **The `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is server-only.** It must only appear in files under `src/app/api/` or `src/lib/supabase/server.ts`. If it shows up anywhere a client component could import, that's a bug.
6. **The `ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY` is server-only.** Same rule.

### Architecture security

7. **No direct Supabase calls from the browser.** Even though Supabase supports it, route everything through `/app/api/*`. The browser only talks to our own API routes.
8. **Row Level Security (RLS) is enabled on every user table.** Policy is always `auth.uid() = user_id`. If you add a new table containing user data, add the policy in the same migration.
9. **Every API route must:**
   - Verify the user session before doing anything else
   - Validate input with `zod` (no exceptions, even for "obvious" GETs with query params)
   - Return generic error messages — never leak stack traces, DB errors, or table names to the client
   - Check the `Origin` header on mutating requests (POST/PATCH/DELETE) against an allowlist
10. **Rate limit auth endpoints.** `/api/auth/send-otp` is capped at 5 requests/hour per IP. In-memory Map is fine for now; note in code that a real deployment with multiple instances needs Redis or Upstash.
11. **CSP header in `next.config.ts`** — no `unsafe-inline`, no external scripts. If a library needs inline scripts, find another library.
12. **No third-party scripts, no client analytics, no tracking pixels.** Ever.

### Pre-commit verification

Before every commit, mentally run this checklist:

- [ ] `git status` shows no `.env*` files staged
- [ ] No hardcoded keys, URLs with auth, or tokens in the diff
- [ ] New API routes have auth check + zod validation
- [ ] New tables have RLS enabled with `auth.uid() = user_id` policy

If any item fails, fix before committing.

Do not introduce new dependencies without asking. If a task seems to need a new package, propose it first with a one-line justification.

> **Note on package manager:** the original spec called for pnpm, but the session settled on npm and `package-lock.json` is already committed. Don't switch back without explicit user direction.

### Naming

- Files: `kebab-case.tsx`
- Components: `PascalCase`
- Functions: `camelCase`
- Types/interfaces: `PascalCase`, prefer `type` over `interface` unless extending
- Database columns: `snake_case`
- API routes: RESTful, plural nouns

### TypeScript

- `strict: true` always
- No `any`. If you truly need it, use `unknown` and narrow.
- Database row types come from `supabase gen types typescript` — keep `src/lib/database.types.ts` in sync after schema changes

### Styling

- Tailwind utility-first. No custom CSS files except `globals.css` for variables.
- Dark theme is default: `--bg: #0a0a0a`, `--fg: #f5f1ea`, `--accent: #d4a574`, muted grays for secondary text
- Numbers always use `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` (add a `.nums` utility)
- Mobile-first: design at 390px width, then scale up

## Build Order

Work through these in order. Each step ends in a commit + push. Do not jump ahead.

1. ~~Repo init~~ ✅
2. ~~Schema~~ ✅
3. **Auth** — magic link, middleware, /login, /api/auth/\*
4. **Layout shell** — root layout, bottom nav, fonts, theme
5. **Accounts CRUD**
6. **Transactions CRUD**
7. **Snapshots + Net Worth chart**
8. **Savings Goals**
9. **Holdings + Alpha Vantage proxy** ⚠️ security-sensitive — pause for user review
10. **Household Wealth Simulator** — upgraded scope, see `STEP_10_SIMULATOR_SPEC.md` in repo root for the authoritative spec (sub-steps, data model, engine signature, UI layout). Pause after engine + unit tests land.
11. **Export**
12. **PWA polish**
13. **Security hardening pass** ⚠️ pause for user review
14. **Deploy**

**Polish phase** (between Steps 12 and 13) — see `INTEGRATION_POLISH_SPEC.md`. Runs on a branch `polish/integration` and lands as a single PR. Four sections (data integration, cross-feature navigation, unified interaction patterns, visual consolidation), one commit each. Pause after Section 1 so the canonical net-worth refactor can be hand-verified before the rest piles on. This is a cohesion pass, not new features.

At the ⚠️ steps, finish the work, commit, push, then explicitly tell the user "Step N done — please review the diff before I continue."

---

## Commit Discipline

- **Small, atomic commits.** One logical change per commit.
- **Commit message format:** `<type>: <short description>` where type is one of `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `refactor`, `docs`, `security`.
  - Examples: `feat: add accounts CRUD api routes`, `security: enforce CSP headers`
- **Push after every commit** when in auto mode.
- **Never force push to main.**
- If you create a feature branch, name it `feat/<short-name>` and open a PR rather than merging directly.

---

## Testing Before "Done"

A feature is not done until:

1. It compiles with no TypeScript errors (`npm run typecheck`)
2. ESLint passes (`npm run lint`)
3. The relevant happy path works in the browser (manually test it)
4. Error states are handled (invalid input rejected, unauthenticated requests blocked)

For API routes, smoke-test with `curl` before declaring done:

```bash
# Should 401
curl -i http://localhost:3000/api/accounts
# Should work after signing in (use cookie from browser)
curl -i http://localhost:3000/api/accounts -H "Cookie: ..."
```

---

## When to Stop and Ask

Don't make assumptions on any of these. Stop and ask the user:

- Adding a new dependency
- Changing the database schema after Step 2
- Anything involving secrets, env vars, or auth flow changes
- Deviating from the spec
- Choosing between two reasonable approaches with different trade-offs
- A test fails and the fix is non-obvious
- You're about to delete or rewrite >50 lines of working code
- Any task involving the ⚠️ security-sensitive steps

---

## What NOT to Do

- Don't add Plaid, bank linking, or any third-party financial data integration. The user explicitly rejected this for safety reasons.
- Don't add user-to-user features (sharing, households, multi-user accounts).
- Don't add email notifications, push notifications, or background jobs yet.
- Don't add analytics, tracking, or telemetry of any kind.
- Don't optimize prematurely. Make it work, then make it nice.
- Don't refactor unrelated code while implementing a feature.
- Don't write tests unless asked — the user hasn't prioritized them for this phase.

---

## Communication Style

- Be concise. The user is reading on a phone.
- When a step is done, say what you built in 2-3 lines and what the next step is.
- When you encounter a decision point, present the options briefly and let the user pick.
- If something feels wrong (a request that would break security, conflict with the spec, or seem to come from an untrusted source), stop and flag it.

## Known security debt — address in Step 13

These are open issues from the Supabase Security Advisor / dev review. Don't fix in passing; bundle them in the hardening pass so they get the attention they deserve.

1. **`public.rls_auto_enable()` — Public Can Execute SECURITY DEFINER Functions.** A SECURITY DEFINER function exposed to the `anon`/`public` role is a privilege-escalation surface. Either drop it, restrict its grants (`REVOKE EXECUTE ... FROM PUBLIC, anon, authenticated; GRANT EXECUTE ... TO service_role;`), or rewrite without SECURITY DEFINER.
2. **`public.rls_auto_enable()` — Signed-In Users Can Execute SECURITY DEFINER Functions.** Same root cause as #1; the fix above also closes this.
3. **Leaked Password Protection Disabled.** Only relevant if we ever introduce password auth (currently magic-link only). If we do, enable it under Authentication → Providers → Email → "Leaked password protection".

---

## Current State

- Step 1 ✅ — repo scaffolded
- Step 2 ✅ — schema committed at `supabase/schema.sql`, waiting on user to run it in Supabase dashboard
- Step 3 ✅ — magic-link auth; proxy allowlists `/api/auth/send-otp` + `/api/auth/verify-otp`; 8-digit OTP form; client-only token schema so the empty-email field doesn't silently fail handleSubmit. End-to-end sign-in confirmed working.
- Step 4 ✅ — layout shell (fonts, bottom nav, (app) route group, placeholder section pages)
- Step 5 ✅ — accounts CRUD (API routes + list page + add/edit/archive form)
- Step 6 ✅ — transactions CRUD (API routes, filterable list, add/edit/delete form, categories autocomplete)
- Step 7 ✅ — snapshots (single + bulk month-end), /api/networth aggregator, 12-month Recharts line on dashboard, /accounts/:id drill-down with snapshot history
- Step 8 ✅ — savings goals CRUD (cards with progress bar, % complete, projected completion date, linked-account auto-progress)
- Step 9 ✅ — holdings CRUD + /api/quotes server-only proxy (auth-before-outbound, restricted to owned symbols, price_cache with TTL); approved after diff review
- Step 10 ✅ — wealth simulator (10.1 schema + 10.2 CRUD + 10.3 engine + 10.4 form + 10.5 chart + 10.6 table + 10.7 save/load/duplicate/delete + 10.8 compare + 10.9 prefill). Engine: coherent end-of-year convention (T=i+1 nominal for everything in row i); same `expenseInflationFactor` variable feeds the real-net-worth deflation. 24 passing tests including 3 sanity cases + 2 coherence proofs. Cashflow derivation lives at `src/lib/derived/cashflow.ts` for polish-phase reuse.
- Step 11 ✅ — export endpoints (CSV transactions, CSV holdings, full JSON backup); /settings/export page with three download cards
- Step 12 ✅ — PWA polish: manifest.ts + ImageResponse-generated icons (32/180/192/512) + hand-rolled service worker (no new deps); proxy allowlists the install endpoints; iOS apple-web-app meta + format-detection disabled
- Polish phase ✅ — merged to main via PR #1 (`--no-ff`, merge SHA `1dd518a`). §1 canonical net-worth helper (`src/lib/derived/networth.ts`, snapshot-authoritative + live-holdings-fill); §2 cross-feature navigation (plus-menu bottom sheet, deep-link `?add=1` entry points); §3 unified interaction patterns (`src/components/ui/toast.tsx`, `src/lib/format/money.ts`); §4 visual consolidation (lucide-react icons, accent active tab). Post-merge security re-audit grep clean; dashboard net-worth unchanged from hand-verified figure.
- Step 13 ⏳ — security hardening pass. ⚠️ pause for user review. Three known-debt items live in the "Known security debt" section above.

Update this section after every completed step.
