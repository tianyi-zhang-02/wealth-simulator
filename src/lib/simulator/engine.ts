/**
 * Pure deterministic simulation engine. No DB, no network, no randomness.
 *
 * ## Simplifying assumptions (documented for honesty about scope)
 *
 *   1. **Flat effective tax rate.** `effectiveTaxRatePct` is applied as a
 *      single household-wide multiplier on gross income. No federal/state
 *      brackets, no FICA, no tax-advantaged account modeling, no
 *      preferential treatment of long-term capital gains or qualified
 *      dividends. Tune the rate to absorb whatever blend matches your
 *      situation.
 *   2. **Two pools: invested vs cash.** Only the `invested` pool (seeded by
 *      `startingInvested`) earns `investment.returnPct`; the `cash` pool —
 *      the rest of starting net worth plus the un-invested share of each
 *      year's surplus — counts toward net worth but earns NOTHING. Bills
 *      come first: shortfalls and housing costs draw cash before touching
 *      investments. `investedSharePct` (default 100) sets how much of a
 *      positive surplus actually gets invested. No bond/stock allocation
 *      within the invested pool.
 *   3. **No Social Security, no pensions, no annuities.** Income outside
 *      the career stages comes only from windfalls.
 *   4. **Optional home + mortgage.** When `assumptions.mortgage` is set,
 *      net worth = invested + cash + (home value − mortgage balance): the
 *      down payment converts cash→equity, each payment splits into interest
 *      (a cost) and principal (equity), property tax + maintenance are
 *      costs, and the home appreciates. Absent = no housing modeled.
 *   5. **Start-of-year growth convention.** Each year, this year's
 *      `investmentGrowth` is computed from the END of last year's
 *      balance, BEFORE this year's contributions, windfalls, and any
 *      shortfall draws. New money therefore doesn't compound within its
 *      first year.
 *   6. **Derived-savings cash flow.** Savings is not a knob — it falls out
 *      of income, tax, and spending:
 *        `afterTaxIncome = grossIncome × (1 − effectiveTaxRatePct/100)`
 *        `saved = afterTaxIncome − expenses + extraAnnualContribution`
 *      - `saved` can go negative — that's a drawdown from the invested
 *        balance (spending exceeds after-tax income).
 *      - Windfalls always go straight to the balance, untaxed (separate
 *        from `saved`).
 *      - `grossIncome` includes salary + bonus + equity (RSUs) across all
 *        people; see `personSalaryForYear`. All of it is taxed at the flat
 *        effective rate (RSUs vest as ordinary income).
 *      - `extraAnnualContribution` is the additional savings dollars used
 *        by the goal-seek "save $X/mo more" lever. Defaults to 0. In this
 *        derived model it is mathematically identical to reducing expenses
 *        by the same amount.
 *      - The **implied savings rate** (`saved / afterTaxIncome`) is a
 *        derived OUTPUT the UI can display; it is not an input.
 *   6a. **Lifestyle creep.** Only moves the expense side (which then
 *      directly reduces `saved` per #6). Per `assumptions.lifestyle.mode`:
 *      - Absent OR `flat` with `lifestyleCreepPct=0`: no creep.
 *        `expenses_i = recurringAnnualExpenses × (1+infl)^(i+1) + major[i]`.
 *      - `flat`: expenses grow at inflation AND a lifestyle drift rate.
 *        `expenses_i = recurringAnnualExpenses
 *                      × (1+infl)^(i+1)
 *                      × (1+creep)^(i+1)
 *                      + major[i]`.
 *      - `incomeScaled`: expenses start at the same year-0 baseline as
 *        flat, then each subsequent year inflate the prior baseline AND
 *        absorb `creepShareOfRaisePct` % of any after-tax raise:
 *        `baseline_0   = recurringAnnualExpenses × (1+infl)`
 *        `baseline_i+1 = baseline_i × (1+infl)
 *                        + max(0, afterTax_i+1 − afterTax_i)
 *                          × creepShareOfRaisePct/100`
 *        `expenses_i   = baseline_i + major[i]`.
 *      A pay cut is clamped (`max(0, …)`) so lifestyle is sticky downward.
 *   7. **Inflation — coherent end-of-year convention.**
 *      Every value in row i is interpreted as T=i+1 nominal
 *      (end-of-year-i). Concretely:
 *      - Investment growth implicitly converts T=i nominal balance to
 *        T=i+1 nominal via `× (1 + returnPct)`, so balance_end_row_i
 *        already lives in T=i+1 nominal.
 *      - `recurringAnnualExpenses` is the user's spend in today's
 *        dollars (T=0). Row i's nominal expenses apply
 *        `(1+infl)^(i+1)` — the first horizon year is one inflation
 *        period from "now."
 *      - Major-expense and windfall face values are taken as-is in
 *        their row's nominal currency (T=i+1). No internal factor.
 *      - Real (today-dollars) value of anything in row i:
 *        `value / (1+infl)^(i+1)`. Expense column and net-worth column
 *        in the same row deflate by EXACTLY THE SAME factor.
 *      - Salaries already grow via `annualRaisePct` (NOMINAL); don't
 *        add inflation on top.
 *   8. **Real net worth.** `netWorthRealTodayDollars = netWorth /
 *      (1 + inflation)^(yearsElapsed + 1)`, computed from the same
 *      `expenseInflationFactor` variable below to make the coherence
 *      visible at the call site.
 *
 * The engine is intentionally forgiving about unknown keys on the
 * `Assumptions` object — anything not enumerated below is ignored. This
 * keeps stored scenarios forward-compatible with future engine versions.
