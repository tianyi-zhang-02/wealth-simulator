/**
 * Goal-seek solver: given a target net worth at a target age, compute what
 * each of four levers would have to be — on its own, holding everything
 * else fixed — to close the gap.
 *
 * Methodology choice (intentional):
 *   Each lever is solved by *bisection over the existing engine*, NOT by
 *   deriving a closed-form formula. Closed forms introduce a new math
 *   surface that has to be re-verified; bisection just reuses the engine
 *   the user has already signed off on. That's the correctness guarantee
 *   — if the engine is right, the solver is right by construction.
 *
 * What this is and isn't:
 *   This is a planning illustration. The output is "if you changed lever X
 *   to Y, the engine projects you'd hit the target" — a conditional
 *   describing the model's behavior, not financial advice. The UI must
 *   surface that framing; the solver returns numbers, not instructions.
 *
 * Levers (each independently held in `LeverResults`):
 *   - extraMonthlyContribution: $/mo of additional savings on top of the
 *     scenario's existing savings-rate calculation.
 *   - returnPct: the base nominal return assumption.
 *   - annualExpenses: recurring household expenses baseline.
 *   - targetAge: the age by which the target is hit (lever varies the age
 *     itself, holding the dollar amount fixed).
 *
 * Search bounds were picked to be wide enough to capture realistic answers
 * without exploding to absurd numbers. If a lever can't close the gap
 * inside its bound, the solver reports {ok: false} with a human-readable
 * reason; the UI shows "not reachable by X alone" instead of a misleading
 * boundary value.
