 * Next.js 16 proxy (the renamed `middleware`). Runs on every request that

 *   1. Refresh the Supabase session cookie when needed.
 *   2. Redirect unauthenticated users to /login (except for public paths).
 *   3. Redirect already-authenticated users away from /login.

/**
 * Public routes are explicitly allowlisted by exact path to keep the
 * surface area tiny. The send/verify OTP routes must be reachable by
 * unauthenticated users — without them in this list, the proxy would
 * redirect their POST to /login (HTTP 307), the browser's fetch would
 * follow as a POST to /login, get a 200 HTML body back, and the client
 * would *think* it succeeded while Supabase was never called.
 *
 * Do NOT widen this to a `/api/auth/` prefix — that would open any
 * future auth route by default. Add new routes by name on purpose.
 *
 * /api/auth/signout intentionally stays gated; an unauthenticated POST
 * to it has nothing to sign out anyway.
