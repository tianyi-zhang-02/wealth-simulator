# Tracker

A personal, mobile-first PWA for tracking net worth, income, savings goals, and a manually-entered investment portfolio with live market prices. Built for one user — no sharing, no bank linking, no analytics. Just numbers and charts that feel like a private banking app.

> Stack: Next.js 16 (App Router) · TypeScript · Supabase (Postgres + Auth) · Tailwind v4 · Recharts · Alpha Vantage (free tier) · Deployed on Vercel.

**Live (the original author's instance):** https://tracker-gamma-eight-14.vercel.app

## Features

### Private (signed-in)

- **Dashboard.** Single hero net-worth figure, liquid vs. invested split, month-over-month delta, 12-month sparkline. All numbers come from one canonical helper — see [Architecture](#architecture) below.
- **Accounts.** CRUD for cash / savings / brokerage / retirement / crypto / other. Currency per account. Per-account balance shown with provenance tag (snapshot vs. live-holdings fill).
- **Transactions.** Income / expense / savings deposit / savings withdrawal. Filterable list, category autocomplete from prior entries.
- **Snapshots.** Per-account month-end balances. Single-account form + bulk month-end form ("here's everything as of last month"). Drives the historical chart.
- **Savings goals.** Target amount, monthly contribution, optional target date, optional linked account. Progress bars + projected completion date + auto-progress from linked-account snapshots.
- **Portfolio.** Holdings CRUD at the brokerage/retirement/crypto level. Tap "refresh prices" to fetch live Alpha Vantage quotes (server-side, rate-limited, cached). Unrealized gain/loss vs. cost basis.
- **Wealth simulator (`/simulator`).** Year-by-year household projection from your own assumptions. Multi-person careers with searchable role library (legal + SWE/MLE), windfalls, major one-time + recurring expenses, lifestyle creep (flat or income-scaled), goal-seek mode that solves four levers ("$X by age Y, what am I missing?"). Save / load / duplicate / compare scenarios. "Use my actual data" prefill seeds the scenario from your real net worth + cashflow.
- **Export.** Transactions CSV, holdings CSV, full JSON backup. The JSON backup supports optional **client-side AES-GCM encryption** with a passphrase that never leaves the browser (PBKDF2-SHA-256, 600k iterations).
- **PWA.** Installable on iOS + Android via "Add to Home Screen". Custom icons, offline shell, hand-rolled service worker (no third-party PWA libs).

### Public (no login)

- **`/sim`.** A standalone shareable Wealth Projection Simulator. Same engine as the authed `/simulator`, with the data wiring deliberately stripped: no saved scenarios, no "use my actual data" prefill, no link to the rest of the app. Friends can build projections, compare, and export JSON entirely client-side. The wall between this page and the private app is the entire risk surface of the public route — see `PUBLIC_SIM_AND_PRIVATE_FEATURES_SPEC.md` Workstream A.

## Security model

**This repo is public.** The threat model assumes a stranger reads every line of code and tries to break in. The codebase is structured around these invariants:

- **All database access is server-side.** The browser never imports the Supabase client; it talks to Next.js API routes under `/app/api/*`. The `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` lives only on the server.
- **Row Level Security is enabled on every user table** (`auth.uid() = user_id`) as defense in depth. `price_cache` enables RLS with no policies — only the service-role key can touch it.
- **Auth is magic link only** (Supabase email OTP, 8-digit codes). No passwords, no OAuth providers.
- **The Alpha Vantage key is server-only** (exact name: `ALPHAVANTAGE_API_KEY`, no underscore between `ALPHA` and `VANTAGE`). The browser hits `/api/quotes`; the server validates the user owns the requested symbols, then proxies and caches via the `price_cache` table to stay inside the free tier (25 calls/day).
- **Strict Content-Security-Policy** with per-request nonce: `script-src 'self' 'nonce-X' 'strict-dynamic'` (no `unsafe-inline`, no `unsafe-eval`). `style-src-attr 'unsafe-inline'` is the documented narrow escape hatch for Recharts SVG.
- **Origin-header CSRF checks** on every mutating route (16/16 audited).
- **zod validation** on every input. Every `z.string()` bounded by `.max() / .length() / .uuid() / .email() / .regex()`.
- **`npm audit` 0/0/0** as of Step 13. Maintained via the `postcss` override in `package.json`.
- **No third-party scripts, no client-side analytics, no telemetry.** Ever.

See `CLAUDE.md` for the full hard-rule list. Known security debt is tracked in the same file.

## Architecture

The pieces worth knowing about before reading code.

### Canonical net-worth helper — `src/lib/derived/networth.ts`

**Single source of truth for "what is the user's net worth right now?".** Every UI surface that shows a net-worth number — dashboard hero, accounts-list total, `/api/networth` route, simulator's "Use my actual data" prefill, savings-goal progress — calls `computeNetWorth()`. If a new screen needs a balance figure, it MUST go through this helper. Inventing a parallel calculation is the kind of drift this file exists to prevent.

The holdings → net-worth model (resolved during the polish-pass §1 work):

- **Brokerage / retirement / crypto WITH a snapshot:** the snapshot wins. The user explicitly stated this account's value at a point in time; live holdings are informational on the portfolio page only.
- **Brokerage / retirement / crypto WITHOUT a snapshot but WITH holdings:** balance = `sum(quantity × live price)`. On Alpha Vantage failure (rate-limited, unknown symbol, etc.), falls back to cost basis for that holding so the account isn't silently zeroed.
- **Cash / savings / other:** snapshot wins, with 0 as fallback.

The helper returns a per-account `source` field (`'snapshot' | 'holdings' | 'none'`) so the UI can render the distinction. Historical 12-period series uses snapshots only — Alpha Vantage's free tier doesn't expose historical prices.

The file is `'server-only'` and lives outside `/api/*` so server components and API routes can both call it directly without an HTTP round-trip.

### Cashflow helper — `src/lib/derived/cashflow.ts`

Sibling to the net-worth helper. Aggregates transaction history into trailing baseline expenses + savings rate + months observed. Powers the simulator's "Use my actual data" prefill.

### Pure simulation engine — `src/lib/simulator/engine.ts`

`simulate(assumptions)` → year-by-year projection. Deterministic, no I/O, fully unit-tested (54 tests across engine + goalSeek + scenarios-demo + simulator-v2-demo). Documented inflation convention (end-of-year, all row-i values nominal at T=i+1), eight enumerated simplifying assumptions, lifestyle-creep modes that compose with the savings-rate cap without double-counting. The pure-function design is what lets `/sim` reuse the engine without touching any data layer.

### Proxy (Next.js 16 middleware) — `src/proxy.ts`

Per-request CSP nonce generation, public-path allowlist, Supabase session refresh. The public-path allowlist is **exact match only** — adding a `/` to widen a prefix would silently auto-public any future subpath.

## Setup

Looking to **run your own copy**? Follow **[SELF_HOSTING_GUIDE.md](./SELF_HOSTING_GUIDE.md)** for the end-to-end walkthrough. The TL;DR version below is for someone already familiar with the stack.

```bash
# 1. Clone & install (Node ≥ 20.19 recommended)
git clone https://github.com/<you>/tracker.git
cd tracker
npm install

# 2. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env.local
# Fill in NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL, NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY,
# SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY, ALPHAVANTAGE_API_KEY, NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL.

# 3. Apply DB schema + migrations
# In the Supabase SQL editor, run:
#   - supabase/schema.sql
#   - then every file in supabase/migrations/ in numerical order
# See supabase/migrations/README.md for what each migration does.

# 4. Configure Supabase Auth
# Site URL = http://localhost:3000 (or your prod URL)
# Redirect URLs include http://localhost:3000/auth/confirm
# Magic-link email template uses {{ .Token }} (NOT {{ .ConfirmationURL }}).

# 5. Run
npm run dev   # → http://localhost:3000
```

## Deployment

Vercel: import the repo, set the same five env vars, deploy. Update Supabase's _Authentication → URL Configuration_ with the production domain so magic-link redirects work. No `vercel.json` required — Next 16 is a zero-config verified adapter on Vercel.

Full deploy operator runbook: [STEP_14_DEPLOY.md](./STEP_14_DEPLOY.md).
